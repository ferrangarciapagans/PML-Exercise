# PML-Exercise
In this Repository you'll find my submission for the Practical machine Learning course project.

You will find the exercise in:
- practica.rm                                        ==> R markdown with my analysis.
- practica.html                                      ==> HTML file with your analysis
- http://rpubs.com/FerranGarcia/exercise             ==> I think this format is easier to read.
